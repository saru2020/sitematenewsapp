Introduction
Requirements
Bonus points

Introduction
Your challenge is to create a simple mobile app that calls an API with user input & displays the results.

API
You can use any API you're familiar with that has a search feature & returns data. 
If you don't have an API, use this news API, which will return news articles based on search text. 
See full documentation here: 
https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started 

You can either sign up for your own API Key, or use this key:

Mobile App
We use React Native here at Sitemate, but you can select the technology youâ€™re most familiar with.
The app should:
display search box(s) 
Call the api on a button or key press (decide which one has the best UX)
display the results so they can be fully read

Requirements
1. Your App should call the API & display results
2. Create a git repo in either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc. Commit & push as you would for normally, we expect to see at least a few separate commits. Please share the url in the submission page
3. Please use Loom to record a short, 2-5 minutes high-level walkthrough for your solution covering the following points:
Your technology choices
Your app design
Demonstrate a few operations
Any improvements you would like to make

Bonus points
If you finish within the time limit, feel free to address one or more of these items:
Elegantly handle errors
Improve the styling of the app
Improve the usability of the app
